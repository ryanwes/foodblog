Code Louisville Project

This project is designed to be a food blog - with the expectation of reflecting what I enjoy making in my kitchen.  

The project starts out with a designed automatic slideshow of three images.  The slide show uses javascript to rotate the three images and there is a media query on the style sheet to provide a better experience on smaller screens.

The site then transitions into recipes - rows of three elements.  The section is designed with a table format to organize the images for the recipes assigning three to a class.  All of the recipes have links under them that link to a separate html page which contains the recipes.  The images are designed with a hover feature to allow them to transform and move up while hovering.  The images are designed with a media query to transition the three columns into one column to provide a better experience on smaller screens.

After those nine recipes it transitions into a section titled essentials.  The essentials are formatted similarily to the recipes except they don't have clickable links and they have a text section after the image describing the image.  

Following this there is a unit converter.  The converter uses two functions that perform math operations to convert from mililiters to tablespoons and tablespoons to mililiters.  You enter a value in one of the fields and click the button "Convert unit" and the value populates in the other textbox.  

The final section on the page is a "Join Our Food Community" form.  This form is desingned to validate email address and password.  The email section requires a valid email address in the format ex: aabb@gmail.com.  The password section requires six characters before successfully validating.
