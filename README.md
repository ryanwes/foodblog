Code Louisville Project

I created this project to be a food blog.  The project starts out with an automatic slideshow of three images.

The site then transitions into recipes - rows of three elements.  These are recipes which have clickable links that lead to a separate html page which contains that image's recipe.  

After those nine recipes it transitions into a section I titled as essentials.  These essentials are formatted similarily to the recipes except they don't have clickable links and they have a text section after the image describing the image.  

The final section is the form - I've titled this section (Join our Food Community).  The form will ask for a username and password.  The password requires six characters - if less than 6 characters are entered an alert will say 6 characaters are required.
