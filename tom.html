</div>
    <div class=recs>
    <p>
        This is a great dish for a cold night.  A light stew with great flavor - pairs perfectly with grilled cheese
        or a light/fluffy bread. 
     </p>
     
     <ul>
         <li>1/2 cup roughly chopped parsley</li>
         <li>2 tsp lemon zest</li>
         <li>2 10ozz containers cherry or grape tomatoes</li>
         <li>1/2 cup olive oil, plus 2 Tbsp + more for drizzling</li>
         <li>1 Tbsp fresh thyme leaves</li>
         <li>salt + pepper</li>
         <li>1 medium yellow onion, thinly sliced</li>
         <li>3 large garlic cloves, thinly sliced</li>
         <li>1/2 tsp red pepper flakes</li>
         <li>2 15oz cans white beans</li>
         <li>1 1/2 cups chicken broth</li>
         <li>flaky salt, for serving</li>
         </ul>

         <ol>
             <li>Heat the oven to 425 degrees.  In a large bowl, gently toss the parsley and lemenon zest until well combined;
                 set aside.
             </li>
             <li>In a large baking dish or on a sheet pan, toss the tomatoes with 1/4 cup of oil and thyme; season well with salt
                 and pepper.  Roast tomatoes until they have collapsed and begin to turn golden around the edges, 20 t0 25 minutes.
             </li>
             <li>When the tomatoes are almost done roasting, heat 2 Tbsp oil in a large deep skillet or Dutch oven over medium.  Add the onion, garlic, and red pepper flakes and 
                 cook until the onion is softened and the garlic is fragrant, 4 to 5 minutes.  Stir in he rinsed beans and broth and bring to a simmer.  With the back of a spoon or
                 spatula, gently smash about 1/2 cup of the beans so they slightly thicken the broth.  If you want a thicker stew, mash some more of the beans.  Season with salt+pepper.
             </li>
             <li>When the tomatoes are finished roasting, add them directly to the stew along with any juices that have been released.  Simmer for 5 to 10 minutes more so the flavors become friendly;
                 season to taste with salt.
             </li>
            <li>Ladle into bowls; top with lemon-parsley mixture, drizzle with olive oil, season with flaky salt.</li>
        </ol>
