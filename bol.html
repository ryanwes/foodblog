        Carbs are a wonder ingredient in any meal at any time of day - add bolognese sauce and it is an Event.  Bolognese is a classic meat based sauce
        that takes a combination of time and fresh ingredients to provide a delicious meal.

     <ul>
         <li>1 Tbsp olive oil</li>
         <li>3 Tbsp butter, plus 1 Tbsp for tossing with pasta</li>
         <li>1/2 cup chopped onion</li>
         <li>2/3 cup chopped celery</li>
         <li>2/3 cup chopped carrot</li>
         <li>3/4 lb ground beef chuck</li>
         <li>salt+pepper</li>
         <li>1 cup whole milk</li>
         <li>whole nutmeg</li>
         <li>1 cup dry white wine</li>
         <li>1 1/2 cups canned imported Italian plum tomatoes, cut up with their juice</li>
         <li>1/4 to 1/2 lbs pasta</li>
         <li>fresh parmesan cheese at the table</li>
         </ul>

         <ol>
             <li>Put the oil, butter, and onion in the pot and turn the heat on to medium.  Cook and stir
                 the onion until it has become translucent, then add the chopped celery and carrot.  Cook for about 2 minutes, stirring vegetables to coat turn well.
             </li>
             <li>Add ground beef, a large pinch of salt, and a few grinds of black pepper.  Crumble the meat with a fork, sitr well and cook until the beef has lost
                 its raw, red color.
             </li>
             <li>Add milk and let it simmer gently, stirring frequently, until has bubbled away completley.  Add a tiny grating -  1/8 tsp of nutmeg and stir.</li>
             <li>Add the wine, let it simmer unitl it has evaporated, then add the tomatoes and stir throughly to coat all ingredients well.  When the tomoatoes begin to bubble, turn th heat down so that the sauce cooks at the slowest
                 of simmers, with just an intermittent bubble breaking through to the surface.  Cook, uncovered, for 3 hours or more, stirring from time to time.
                 While the sauce is cooking, you are likely to find that it begins to dry out and the fat separates from the heat.  To keep it from sticking, add 1/2 cup of water whenever necessary.   At the end, however, no water at all must be left and the fat must separate from the sauce.  
                 Taste and correct for sauce.
             </li>
            <li>Toss with cooked drained pasta, adding the Tbs of butter, and serve with freshly grated parmesan on the side.</li>
