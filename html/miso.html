    <h1>Maple Miso Salmon</h1>
    </Header>
    <p>
        I love making salmon because it is very difficult to ruin and is delicious.  Miso is something I'd never heard of but packs so much power 
        and is an amazing addition to salmon.  Serves great with roasted sesame broccoli.

     <ul>
         <li>4 (6oz) skiin-on salmon fillets</li>
         <li>salt+pepper</li>
