    </Header>
    <p>
        This dish is a perfect meal any night and the best leftovers you'll ever have!  The key is to not crowd the wok,
        giving the ingredients enough space to cook in the high heat.
     </p>
     
     <ul>
         <li>9oz dried rice stick noodles</li>
         <li>2 Tbs vegetable oil</li>
         <li>10oz raw prawns(shrimp)</li>
         <li>2 eggs</li>
         <li>1 cup bean sprouts</li>
         <li>2 Tbs finey chopped pickled turnip (optional)</li>
         <li>small handful of chives or garlic chives, snipped into 1 inch pieces</li>
         <li>Lime wedges, roasted and coarsely ground peanuts and coriander (cilantro) leaves, to serve</li>
    </ul>

        <p2>Sauce</p2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 Tbsp vegetable oil</li>
                <li>3 garlic cloves, finely chopped</li>
                <li>3 bird's eye chillies (or 1 thumb-size red chili), stems removed
                    finely chopped
                </li>
                <li>2 1/2 Tbs grated palm sugar or soft brown sugar</li>
                <li>3oz tamarind puree mixed with 1 3/4oz water</li>
                <li>1 3/4oz fish suace</li>
                <li>2 tsp light soy sauce</li>
            </ul>
         <ol>
             <li>Break the noodles into 6inch pieces and put them in a large bowl.  Cover withwarm water and stand for 20 minutes.
                 They should soften, but they will still be fairly firm when you start to cook them.
             </li>
             <li>Meanwhile, to make the pad Thai sauce, heat the vegetable oil in a wok over low heat.  Add the garlic and chilli and stir for 1 minute.
                 Add the remaining ingredients and stir for 1 minute or until the sauce dissolves.  Pour into a small bowl and clean the wok.
             </li>
             <li>You can only make 2 portions at a time in the wok, but it doesn't take long to cook and is better than crowding the wok.  Heat the wok over high heat and add 1 Tbsp of vegetable
                 oil.  When the oil is nearly smoking, add half the prawns and toss for 1 minute or until pink.  Push the prawns to the side and crack an eggs into the centre of the wok.  stir so that it 
                 scrambles.  Add half the bean sprouts and chopped picled turnip (if using) and stir for 1 minute.  Drain
                 the noodles and add half to the wok with half the sauce and half the chives.  Using two long spoons, toss the noodles constantly
                 for 3-4 minutes or until heated through.

             </li>
             <li>Divide the pad Thai between two plates, then wipe the pan clean and repeat with the remaining ingredients.  Scatter with peanuts and coriander and serve
                 with lime wedges.
             </li>
